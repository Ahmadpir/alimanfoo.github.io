I work in Professor [Dominic Kwiatkowski](https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/principal-investigators/researcher/dominic-kwiatkowski)'s group at the [Wellcome Trust Centre for 
Human Genetics](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk), [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), as a member of the [Centre for Genomics and Global 
Health](http://www.cggh.org). I am also affiliated with the [Malaria Programme](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/programmes/malaria) at the [Wellcome Trust Sanger 
Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/) near Cambridge.

I work on the genomics of malaria parasites and vectors. I contribute to [MalariaGEN](http://www.malariagen.net) projects including the [*Anopheles gambiae* 1000 
genomes project](http://www.malariagen.net/ag1000g) and the [*Plasmodium falciparum* genetic crosses project](http://www.malariagen.net/projects/parasite/pf-crosses).
