title: Mosquito genomes and malaria control, the podcast
---

I'm very grateful to the folks at [Oxford
Sparks](http://www.oxfordsparks.ox.ac.uk/) for [featuring
malaria](http://www.oxfordsparks.ox.ac.uk/content/big-questions-killers-1-mosquito-genomes-and-malaria-control)
in their recent podcast series. For the episode I spoke to
[Michaela](https://twitter.com/a_n_s) about the work we're doing on
[Anopheles mosquito genomics](http://www.malariagen.net/ag1000g) and
the threat of insecticide resistance. They have done a marvellous job
editing my stream-of-consciousness into something vaguely coherent! To
listen, try the audio player below, or head over to the [Oxford Sparks
