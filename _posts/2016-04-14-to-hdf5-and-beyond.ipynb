    "When I first discovered the [HDF5 file format](https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) a few years ago it was pretty transformative. I'd been struggling to find efficient ways of exploring and analysing data coming from [our research](http://www.malariagen.net/ag1000g) on genetic variation in the mosquitoes that carry malaria. The data are not enormous - typically integer arrays with around 20 billion elements - but they are too large to work with in memory on a typical laptop or desktop machine. The file formats traditionally used for these data are very slow to parse, so I went looking for an alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "HDF5 files provide a great solution for storing multi-dimensional arrays of numerical data. The arrays are divided up into chunks and each chunk is compressed, enabling data to be stored efficiently in memory or on disk. Depending on how the chunks are configured, usually a good compromise can be achieved that means data can be read very quickly even when using different access patterns, e.g., taking horizontal or vertical slices of a matrix. Also, the [``h5py``](http://www.h5py.org/) Python library provides a very convenient API for working with HDF5 files. I found there was a whole range of analyses I could happily get done on my laptop on the train home from work."

    "In the example above, ``bcolz`` is more than 10 times faster at storing (compressing) the data than HDF5. As I understand it, this performance gain comes from several factors. ``bcolz`` uses a C library called [``blosc``](https://github.com/blosc/c-blosc) internally to perform compression and decompression operations. ``blosc`` can use multiple threads, so some of the work is done in parallel. ``blosc`` also splits data up in a way that is designed to work well with the CPU cache architecture. Finally, ``blosc`` is a meta-compressor and several different compression libraries can be used - above I used the ``lz4`` compressor, which does not achieve quite the same compression ratios as ``gzip`` (``zlib``) but is much faster with numerical data."

    "Speed really makes a difference when working interactively with data, so I started using the ``carray`` class where possible in my analyses, especially for storing intermediate data. However, it does have some limitations. A ``carray`` can be multidimensional, but because ``bcolz`` is not really designed for multi-dimensional data, a ``carray`` can only be chunked along the first dimension. This means taking slices of the first dimension is efficient, but slicing any other dimension will be very inefficient, because the entire array will need to be read and decompressed to access even a single column of a matrix."
