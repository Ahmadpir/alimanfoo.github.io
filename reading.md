      <blockquote class="abstract display_none"> Animal species adapt to changes in their environment, including man-made changes such as the introduction of 
insecticides, through selection for advantageous genes already present in populations or newly arisen through mutation. A possible alternative mechanism is the 
acquisition of adaptive genes from related species via a process known as adaptive introgression. Differing levels of insecticide resistance between two African 
malaria vectors, Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae, have been attributed to assortative mating between the two species. In a previous study, we reported two 
bouts of hybridization observed in the town of Selinkenyi, Mali in 2002 and 2006. These hybridization events did not appear to be directly associated with 
insecticide-resistance genes. We demonstrate that during a brief breakdown in assortative mating in 2006, A. coluzzii inherited the entire A. gambiae-associated 2L 
divergence island, which includes a suite of insecticide-resistance alleles. In this case, introgression was coincident with the start of a major insecticide-treated 
bed net distribution campaign in Mali. This suggests that insecticide exposure altered the fitness landscape, favoring the survival of A. coluzzii/A. gambiae 
hybrids, and provided selection pressure that swept the 2L divergence island through A. coluzzii populations in Mali. We propose that the work described herein 
presents a unique description of the temporal dynamics of adaptive introgression in an animal species and represents a mechanism for the rapid evolution of 
insecticide resistance in this important vector of human malaria in Africa.

      <blockquote class="abstract display_none"> We report the complete cDNA sequence of the Anopheles gambiae voltage-gated sodium 
channel (VGSC) alpha-subunit isolated from mature adult mosquitoes. The genomic DNA contains 35 deduced exons with a predicted translation 
of <or= 2139 amino acid cDNAs. The transcription of the gene is, however, complex, alternate splicing being evident for at least five 
optional exons (or exon segments) and two sets of mutually exclusive exons. Overall gene organization was also compared with that of other 
VGSCs within the Insecta. Several insecticides used in mosquito control (including DDT and synthetic pyrethroids) target the VGSC. 
Isolation of the sodium channel cDNA for An. gambiae: (1) allows prediction of likely single nucleotide polymorphisms that may arise at 
residue L1014 to cause resistance to insecticides; (2) defines An. gambiae exon usage in key areas of the VGSC protein that are known 
(from previous studies in a range of different pest species) to have roles in altering insecticide susceptibility and in generating 
resistance; and (3) is a critical first step towards development of refined malarial control strategies and of new diagnostics for 
resistance monitoring.

      <blockquote class="abstract display_none"> Voltage-gated sodium channels are essential for the initiation and propagation of the action potential in neurons 
and other excitable cells. Because of their critical roles in electrical signaling, sodium channels are targets of a variety of naturally occurring and synthetic 
neurotoxins, including several classes of insecticides. This review is intended to provide an update on the molecular biology of insect sodium channels and the 
molecular mechanism of pyrethroid resistance. Although mammalian and insect sodium channels share fundamental topological and functional properties, most insect 
species carry only one sodium channel gene, compared to multiple sodium channel genes found in each mammalian species. Recent studies showed that two 
posttranscriptional mechanisms, alternative splicing and RNA editing, are involved in generating functional diversity of sodium channels in insects. More than 50 
sodium channel mutations have been identified to be responsible for or associated with knockdown resistance (kdr) to pyrethroids in various arthropod pests and 
disease vectors. Elucidation of molecular mechanism of kdr led to the identification of dual receptor sites of pyrethroids on insect sodium channels. Most of the kdr 
mutations appear to be located within or close to the two receptor sites. The accumulating knowledge of insect sodium channels and their interactions with 
insecticides provides a foundation for understanding the neurophysiology of sodium channels in vivo and the development of new and safer insecticides for effective 
control of arthropod pests and human disease vectors.

      <blockquote class="abstract display_none"> Malaria control is reliant on insecticides to control the mosquito vector. As efforts to control the disease have 
intensified, so has the selection pressure on mosquitoes to develop resistance to these insecticides. The distribution and strength of this resistance has increased 
dramatically in recent years and now threatens the success of control programs. This review provides an update on the current status of resistance to the major 
insecticide classes in African malaria vectors, considers the evidence that this resistance is already compromising malaria control efforts, and looks to the future 
to highlight some of the new insecticide-based tools under development and the challenges in ensuring they are most effectively deployed to manage resistance.

      <blockquote class="abstract display_none"> Alleles subject to strong, recent positive selection will be swept toward fixation together with contiguous sections 
of the genome. Whether the genomic signatures of such selection will be readily detectable in outbred wild populations is unclear. In this study, we employ haplotype 
diversity analysis to examine evidence for selective sweeps around knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations associated with resistance to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane 
and pyrethroid insecticides in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. Both kdr mutations have significantly lower haplotype diversity than the wild-type (nonresistant) 
allele, with kdr L1014F showing the most pronounced footprint of selection. We complement these data with a time series of collections showing that the L1014F allele 
has increased in frequency from 0.05 to 0.54 in 5 years, consistent with a maximum likelihood-fitted selection coefficient of 0.16 and a dominance coefficient of 
0.25. Our data show that strong, recent positive selective events, such as those caused by insecticide resistance, can be identified in wild insect populations.

      <blockquote class="abstract display_none"> Over the past decade the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), in combination with improved drug therapies, 
indoor residual spraying (IRS), and better health infrastructure, has helped reduce malaria in many African countries for the first time in a generation. However, 
insecticide resistance in the vector is an evolving threat to these gains. We review emerging and historical data on behavioral resistance in response to LLINs and 
IRS. Overall the current literature suggests behavioral and species changes may be emerging, but the data are sparse and, at times unconvincing. However, preliminary 
modeling has demonstrated that behavioral resistance could have significant impacts on the effectiveness of malaria control. We propose seven recommendations to 
improve understanding of resistance in malaria vectors. Determining the public health impact of physiological and behavioral insecticide resistance is an urgent 
priority if we are to maintain the significant gains made in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality.

      <blockquote class="abstract display_none"> The renewed effort to eliminate malaria and permanently remove its tremendous burden highlights questions of what 
combination of tools would be sufficient in various settings and what new tools need to be developed. Gene drive mosquitoes constitute a promising set of tools, with 
multiple different possible approaches including population replacement with introduced genes limiting malaria transmission, driving-Y chromosomes to collapse a 
mosquito population, and gene drive disrupting a fertility gene and thereby achieving population suppression or collapse. Each of these approaches has had recent 
success and advances under laboratory conditions, raising the urgency for understanding how each could be deployed in the real world and the potential impacts of 
each. New analyses are needed as existing models of gene drive primarily focus on nonseasonal or nonspatial dynamics. We use a mechanistic, spatially explicit, 
stochastic, individual-based mathematical model to simulate each gene drive approach in a variety of sub-Saharan African settings. Each approach exhibits a broad 
region of gene construct parameter space with successful elimination of malaria transmission due to the targeted vector species. The introduction of realistic 
seasonality in vector population dynamics facilitates gene drive success compared with nonseasonal analyses. Spatial simulations illustrate constraints on release 
timing, frequency, and spatial density in the most challenging settings for construct success. Within its parameter space for success, each gene drive approach 
provides a tool for malaria elimination unlike anything presently available. Provided potential barriers to success are surmounted, each achieves high efficacy at 
reducing transmission potential and lower delivery requirements in logistically challenged settings. </blockquote>

and indirectly by vectoring nutrients, energy, and pathogens. Although linkages between vertebrate movements and ecosystem processes have been established, the 
effects of mass insect "bioflows" have not been described. We quantified biomass flux over the southern United Kingdom for high-flying (>150 meters) insects and show 
that ~3.5 trillion insects (3200 tons of biomass) migrate above the region annually. These flows are not randomly directed in insects larger than 10 milligrams, 
which exploit seasonally beneficial tailwinds. Large seasonal differences in the southward versus northward transfer of biomass occur in some years, although flows 
were balanced over the 10-year period. Our long-term study reveals a major transport process with implications for ecosystem services, processes, and 
biogeochemistry. </blockquote>

      <blockquote class="abstract display_none"> We employed deep genome 
sequencing of two parents and 12 of their offspring to estimate the mutation rate per 
site per generation in a full-sib family of Drosophila melanogaster recently sampled 
from a natural population. Sites that were homozygous for the same allele in the 
parents and heterozygous in one or more offspring were categorized as candidate 
mutations and subjected to detailed analysis. In 1.23 × 10(9) callable sites from 12 
individuals, we confirmed six single nucleotide mutations. We estimated the false 
negative rate in the experiment by generating synthetic mutations using the empirical 
distributions of numbers of nonreference bases at heterozygous sites in the offspring. 
The proportion of synthetic mutations at callable sites that we failed to detect was 
<1%, implying that the false negative rate was extremely low. Our estimate of the 
point mutation rate is 2.8 × 10(-9) (95% confidence interval = 1.0 × 10(-9) - 6.1 × 
10(-9)) per site per generation, which is at the low end of the range of previous 
estimates, and suggests an effective population size for the species of ∼1.4 × 10(6). 
At one site, point mutations were present in two individuals, indicating that there 
had been a premeiotic mutation cluster, although surprisingly one individual had a G→A 
transition and the other a G→T transversion, possibly associated with error-prone 
mismatch repair. We also detected three short deletion mutations and no insertions, 
giving a deletion mutation rate of 1.2 × 10(-9) (95% confidence interval = 0.7 × 
10(-9) - 11 × 10(-9)).</blockquote>
