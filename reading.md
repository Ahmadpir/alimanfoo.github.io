      <blockquote class="abstract display_none"> Over the past decade the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), in combination with improved drug therapies, 
indoor residual spraying (IRS), and better health infrastructure, has helped reduce malaria in many African countries for the first time in a generation. However, 
insecticide resistance in the vector is an evolving threat to these gains. We review emerging and historical data on behavioral resistance in response to LLINs and 
IRS. Overall the current literature suggests behavioral and species changes may be emerging, but the data are sparse and, at times unconvincing. However, preliminary 
modeling has demonstrated that behavioral resistance could have significant impacts on the effectiveness of malaria control. We propose seven recommendations to 
improve understanding of resistance in malaria vectors. Determining the public health impact of physiological and behavioral insecticide resistance is an urgent 
priority if we are to maintain the significant gains made in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality.

      <blockquote class="abstract display_none"> The renewed effort to eliminate malaria and permanently remove its tremendous burden highlights questions of what 
combination of tools would be sufficient in various settings and what new tools need to be developed. Gene drive mosquitoes constitute a promising set of tools, with 
multiple different possible approaches including population replacement with introduced genes limiting malaria transmission, driving-Y chromosomes to collapse a 
mosquito population, and gene drive disrupting a fertility gene and thereby achieving population suppression or collapse. Each of these approaches has had recent 
success and advances under laboratory conditions, raising the urgency for understanding how each could be deployed in the real world and the potential impacts of 
each. New analyses are needed as existing models of gene drive primarily focus on nonseasonal or nonspatial dynamics. We use a mechanistic, spatially explicit, 
stochastic, individual-based mathematical model to simulate each gene drive approach in a variety of sub-Saharan African settings. Each approach exhibits a broad 
region of gene construct parameter space with successful elimination of malaria transmission due to the targeted vector species. The introduction of realistic 
seasonality in vector population dynamics facilitates gene drive success compared with nonseasonal analyses. Spatial simulations illustrate constraints on release 
timing, frequency, and spatial density in the most challenging settings for construct success. Within its parameter space for success, each gene drive approach 
provides a tool for malaria elimination unlike anything presently available. Provided potential barriers to success are surmounted, each achieves high efficacy at 
reducing transmission potential and lower delivery requirements in logistically challenged settings. </blockquote>

      <blockquote class="abstract display_none"> Migrating animals have an impact on ecosystems directly via influxes of predators, prey, and competitors 
and indirectly by vectoring nutrients, energy, and pathogens. Although linkages between vertebrate movements and ecosystem processes have been established, the 
effects of mass insect "bioflows" have not been described. We quantified biomass flux over the southern United Kingdom for high-flying (>150 meters) insects and show 
that ~3.5 trillion insects (3200 tons of biomass) migrate above the region annually. These flows are not randomly directed in insects larger than 10 milligrams, 
which exploit seasonally beneficial tailwinds. Large seasonal differences in the southward versus northward transfer of biomass occur in some years, although flows 
were balanced over the 10-year period. Our long-term study reveals a major transport process with implications for ecosystem services, processes, and 
biogeochemistry. </blockquote>

      <blockquote class="abstract display_none"> We employed deep genome 
sequencing of two parents and 12 of their offspring to estimate the mutation rate per 
site per generation in a full-sib family of Drosophila melanogaster recently sampled 
from a natural population. Sites that were homozygous for the same allele in the 
parents and heterozygous in one or more offspring were categorized as candidate 
mutations and subjected to detailed analysis. In 1.23 × 10(9) callable sites from 12 
individuals, we confirmed six single nucleotide mutations. We estimated the false 
negative rate in the experiment by generating synthetic mutations using the empirical 
distributions of numbers of nonreference bases at heterozygous sites in the offspring. 
The proportion of synthetic mutations at callable sites that we failed to detect was 
<1%, implying that the false negative rate was extremely low. Our estimate of the 
point mutation rate is 2.8 × 10(-9) (95% confidence interval = 1.0 × 10(-9) - 6.1 × 
10(-9)) per site per generation, which is at the low end of the range of previous 
estimates, and suggests an effective population size for the species of ∼1.4 × 10(6). 
At one site, point mutations were present in two individuals, indicating that there 
had been a premeiotic mutation cluster, although surprisingly one individual had a G→A 
transition and the other a G→T transversion, possibly associated with error-prone 
mismatch repair. We also detected three short deletion mutations and no insertions, 
giving a deletion mutation rate of 1.2 × 10(-9) (95% confidence interval = 0.7 × 
10(-9) - 11 × 10(-9)).</blockquote>

      <blockquote class="abstract display_none">We estimated the spontaneous mutation rate in Heliconius 
melpomene by genome sequencing of a pair of parents and 30 of their offspring, 
based on the ratio of number of de novo heterozygotes to the number of 
callable site-individuals. We detected nine new mutations, each one affecting 
a single site in a single offspring. This yields an estimated mutation rate of 
2.9 × 10(-9) (95% confidence interval, 1.3 × 10(-9)-5.5 × 10(-9)), which is 
similar to recent estimates in Drosophila melanogaster, the only other insect 
species in which the mutation rate has been directly estimated. We infer that 
recent effective population size of H. melpomene is about 2 million, a 
substantially lower value than its census size, suggesting a role for natural 
selection reducing diversity. We estimate that H. melpomene diverged from its 
Müllerian comimic H. erato about 6 Ma, a somewhat later date than estimates 
based on a local molecular clock.</blockquote>
